As part of my internship, my first task involved creating a histogram in Excel using the Financial Sample Dataset to analyze and visualize data distributions effectively. This dataset, containing key financial metrics, provided an excellent opportunity to practice organizing data into intervals and calculating frequencies. Utilizing Excel's powerful data analysis tools, I crafted a histogram to represent the distribution of sales and profit metrics, making it easier to identify patterns and trends. This task enhanced my technical proficiency in data visualization and reinforced my ability to communicate insights clearly. Successfully completing this assignment marked a strong start to my internship, laying the groundwork for deeper exploration of data-driven financial analysis.
